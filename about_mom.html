      <h2><p>My love for knitting and making intricate embroideries goes back to my childhood days when I was fascinated by the finesse of my mother's crochet works. I have grown up in a tradition of knitting sweaters for our loved ones without any specific occassions. I have discovered Amigurumi only recently and have developed a passion for the same. In this website I not only intend to make my creations available for purchase, but I also want to reach out to a greater fraternity of crochet-lovers. The simplicity of the techniques of making Amigurumi stuffed toys and other items is what appeals to me. I can never be tired of listening to how my creations have brought a smile on the face of a child.</p>
        <p>The journey of my startup business began only with handmade jewellery. Hailing from Bengal, Durga puja is the biggest festival we celebrate. I started making junk jewellery that would match with the new clothes that we wear during the puja days. I started getting orders from my circle of friends and slowly the circle grew. Gradually, Durga puja was not the only occassion I was making jewellery for. I receive orders for customizable jewellery and deliver them to the respective addresses. Buying the raw materials, creating a design myself or following customer directions for the same, stitching the minute details, packing the finished products and delivering them by post might seem to be cumbersome but it's definitely worth the effort!</p>
        <p>I never planned to add candles and organic soaps to my list of creations. They had merely been experiments, to begin with. The materials used are completely skin-friendly and render no harmful effects. You would always be pleasantly surprised to receive a beautiful hamper containing hand-picked organic soaps of customizabble scents and shapes and moulded candles to light up your house. The general idea was to make something that can be used in our daily activities as well as a decorative item. I have (thankfully) received positive remarks about these items till date and I want to follow the same policy of working slow but maintaining the authenticity of the products, as long as I can manufacture them.</p>
        <p>Homemade chocolates are prepared and manufactured on special requests. These are delicate items whose shapes might be altered due to heat and rough transportation but I try my best.</p>
        <p>Amongst my other hobbies are gardening and cooking. With the onset of the pandemic, I have discovered my potential in both. After a long day of several household chores, these are what lights up my life.</p></h2>

    <h1>I'm Arpita Moitra, a housewife with dreams</h1>
    <p><h3>I have a passion for stitching and knitting, which has made me pursue a tiny domestic business. I am happy to interact and take orders from people who share my love for knitting and also those who are interested to purchase the items I make.
      My love for knitting and embroidery goes back to my childhood days. I have always been inspired by my mother and my daughter, for whom, mainly, I make the stuffed toys.</h3></p>
      <p><h3>I have named my business start-up 'Gourita' which is a tiny collection of handmade jewellery and other items. Kindly head over to this <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Gourita-551572871904312">page</a> to have a look. Jewellery making is one of my interests and it falls under the category of intricate stitching works which has always been my passion.</h3></p>
      <p><h3>Amongst other stuff that I love to make are organic soaps and candles and homemade chocolates. These are easy to make items which are not only useful in our day-to-day activities but also act as decorative and gift items. You would always be pleasantly surprised to receive a neat hamper of wax candles of several shapes or moulded organic soaps of customizable flavours and scents or animal moulded chocolate bars from your near and dear ones! The soaps and the wax used for candles are completely natural and do not render any harmful effects on the skin. These products are available as per orders however, candles are mostly made during the Diwali season</h3></p>
