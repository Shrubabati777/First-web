      <h1>FAQs about Jewellery</h1><ul type="disk">
        <li><h2>How long does it take to make these products?</h2><h3>Depends on the number of orders at hand, the availability of the raw materials (the desired quantity and quality of yarn, beads, metal pieces, etc) and the amount of minute details in the desired product. Generally delivery of the finished product is done within 10-12 days of order.</h3></li>
        <li><h2>How accurate are the products with respect to the orders?</h2><h3>The images shown and the product delivered are mostly similar however there might be slight alterations in minute details due to lack of availability of the exact specifications given by the customer. All wool and yarn colours are not always available. Also, photographic colours of metal parts can be of a slightly different complexion than the real product.</h3></li>
        <li><h2>How safe are the products for children?</h2><h3>Children can safely wear the jewellery however care should be taken for small children as the tiny details such as beads and pointed metal edges or the hooks of the earrings might hurt them.</h3></li>
        <li><h2>Are these products safe for skin?</h2><h3>Care is taken to use only high-quality yarn and metal-parts and the ordered product is hand-made with love. Not recommended for those who are allergic to metal variants.</h3></li>
        <li><h2>How long do the colours persist?</h2><h3>Colours on wool and yarn stay for a long time generally however there might be colour stains on skin and clothes in occassions of excessive sweating. The metal on reaction with the atmosphere becomes black with time.</h3></li>
        <li><h2>How should I take care of the products?</h2><h3>The metal surfaces can be cleaned with an old brush and regular toothpaste in order to prevent blackening. Discoloured metal surfaces can be made to look better using the same process.</h3></li>
